Hello! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a Game Player P.R. Consultant from Polska with a passion for Asian and anime culture. My professional journey has led me to various exciting projects, including the *Arcane Crusade*, *Arcane Crusade 2* and *Eternal Guardians*, where I play a key role in (game) asia community building and localization work. In addition to my consultancy work, I'm an avid gamer and a dedicated player of *War Thunder*, *Star Citizen* and *The Legend of Zelda* (My favourite). I enjoy immersing myself in games and exploring new virtual worlds.

I have a background in technology and a keen interest in software development. Combining my love for gaming and technology, I am currently involved in designing a VRChat in-game map. I'm always open to connecting with like-minded individuals and collaborating on innovative projects.

Working Language: Polski, Chinese, English and Japanese.
